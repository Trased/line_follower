# Introduction
This project is a Line Follower Machine, a type of autonomous robot that can follow a predefined path using infrared sensors to detect the line. It is an excellent beginner project for those interested in robotics, electronics, and Arduino programming.

The robot follows a black line on a white background using three infrared sensors that detect the line's presence and adjust the motor speeds accordingly to stay on course.

## Components

To build this project, you will need the following components:
* x1 Raspberry Pi Pico W 
* x1 HC-05 Bluetooth Module
